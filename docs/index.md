# Introduction

Documentation for the backend system for the tinymotion General Movements Assessment data collection app.

TinyMotion Backend is written in Python and exposes an API (built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)) and also has a command line interface for administering the backend.

The backend is currently under development and likely to change.
